# Sentiment_analysis application

This application is part of my thesis paper which aims to present a solution which could help brands, with a relatively significant social media presence, to understand and summarize their audiences’ feedback, by applying sentiment analysis on the comments found on the company’s Facebook Page posts, in order to find out general mood towards them, their product, or their advertising campaigns, and, hopefully, in some cases, to a higher or lower degree, act on it and even influence it. 

The end result would be an application which connects to a certain entity’s Facebook business account, navigates through all of its social publications, parses the comments for each post, and, through the use of natural language processing techiques and machine learning algorithms, assigns for each of them a sentiment rating, so that social media managers, even influencers and content creators who want to be on top of their audience engagement can figure out reactions, response rates, and expressed opinions about the subject of their posts, or more generally, about their brand.

This is the repository for the application, developed with Java and Spring for the back-end, and React-JS for the front end
